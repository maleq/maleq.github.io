Title: Analytical Foundations for Multi-hop Wireless Networks
</strong> </span> <br>  <br>


<strong>      Abstract: </strong> Multi-hop wireless networks are wireless systems in which wireless nodes are  capable of relaying other nodes' transmissions. The ability to relay can significantly improve network performance over single hop transmissions. Further, these networks can often be implemented with minimal infrastructure needs and find a myriad of applications that have been extensively studied (e.g., mesh, sensor, MANET systems). While multi- hopping improves performance, it also significantly complicates network design, and traditional ad hoc approaches often result in poor overall performance. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop an analytical foundation that is mathematically rigorous, conceptually unifying, and leads to the development of low-complexity and practically-implementable resource allocation algorithms.

       

       In this talk, I will first describe the recent breakthroughs that have taken place in the development of such an analytical framework. In particular, we will discuss the recent successes in the design of "loosely coupled" cross-layer architectures that allows network protocols to be  viewed as optimizers and layering as a functional consequence of mathematical decomposition. We will show that  a rigorous approach to design that accounts for complexity and scalability can lead to substantial performance gains over traditional approaches used in the state-of-the-art design of wireless systems.  The gains can be achieved by the intelligent design of cross-layer solutions that extract efficiency and yet maintain a high degree of modularity and robustness to imperfect decision making. While substantial strides have been made in achieving high throughput and stability, many interesting problems are still open. In the latter half of the talk, I will  describe some of these critical open problems, the various challenges that they pose, and preliminary work on how to resolve them.

Title: Scalable localized routing in wireless sensor networks
</strong> </span> <br>  <br>

<strong> Abstract: </strong>	    Sensors need their position information in order to provide useful monitoring information. In a localized routing algorithm, each node forwards the message solely based on the location of itself, its neighbors and destination. Such path based routing provides better fault tolerance than tree maintenance approaches. In this talk we describe a cost to progress ratio framework for designing greedy routing algorithms, and show that a number of existing schemes are special cases of the design. The cost depends on metric selected, such as hop count, power, remaining energy, delay, expected hop count (which considers realistic physical layer), etc. Recovery schemes are applied when greedy scheme is unable to make progress toward the destination. In greedy schemes, each node forwards the message to a neighbor based on the direction, progress or distance criterion.  A memoryless (stateless) and beaconless GFG (greedy-face-greedy) routing algorithms that guarantees delivery (if destination location is accurate) in unit disk graphs (where nodes can directly communicate iff they are within fixed transmission radius) are presented. We also give design guidelines for network layer protocols in sensor networks.
