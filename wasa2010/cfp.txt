
The Fifth International Conference on Wireless Algorithms, 
Systems and Applications (WASA 2010)
August 15-17, 2010, Beijing, China

The WASA 2010 conference addresses the research and development efforts in the area of 
algorithms, systems and applications for the current and next generation wireless networks. 
It provides a forum for researchers and practitioners around the world to exchange 
ideas, share new findings, and discuss challenges in wireless networks.

This call solicits technical papers that describe original research work, visionary 
approaches, and future research directions dealing with effective and efficient 
algorithm design and analysis, reliable and secure system development and implementations, 
experimental study and test bed validation, and new application explorations in wireless 
networks. 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: 

- Cyber-physical systems (transportation, health care, civil infrastructure, etc)
- Theoretical frameworks and analysis of fundamental cross-layer protocol and network 
design and performance issues
- Distributed and localized algorithm design and analysis 
- Information and Coding theory for Wireless Networks
- Localization 
- Mobility models and mobile social networking
- Topology control and coverage 
- Security and privacy 
- PHY/MAC/Routing  protocols
