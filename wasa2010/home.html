<p> WASA is an international conference on algorithms, systems, and applications of wireless networks. It is motivated by the recent advances in cutting-edge electronic and computer technologies that have paved the way for the proliferation of ubiquitous infrastructure and infrastructureless wireless networks. </p>

<p> WASA is designed to be a forum for theoreticians, system and application designers, protocol developers and practitioners to discuss and express their views on the current trends, challenges, and state of the art solutions related to various issues in wireless networks. Topics of interests include, but not limited to, effective and efficient state-of-the-art algorithm design and analysis, reliable and secure system development and implementations, experimental study and test bed validation, and new application exploration in wireless networks. </p>
<p> In addition to technical sessions and panels, the conference will feature several keynote speeches, given by leading researchers and practitioners in the areas of algorithms, systems, and applications in wireless networks. </p>
<p> Submitted papers should be original, unpublished work and not currently under review for any other conference or journal. Papers not following these guidelines will be rejected. </p>
