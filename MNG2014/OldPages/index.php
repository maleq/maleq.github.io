<p> The Workshop on Mining Networks and Graphs will be held on April 24-26, 2014 in Philadelphia, PA in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm13/">2014 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2014)</a>.

<p> The workshop is targeted for researchers interested data mining, machine learning, massive data analytics, network science, social networks and high performance computing in its broadest sense. Both theoreticians as well as practitioners, including system builders and individuals applying network analytic methods in application domains will be benefited from this workshop.

<p> Networks are emerging as a common language to model a wide variety of systems in life sciences, engineering, and social sciences. Real-world applications give rise to networks that are unstructured and often comprise of multiple-networks. Furthermore, they support multiple dynamical processes that shape the network over time. Network science refers to the broad discipline that seeks to understand the underlying principles that govern the synthesis, analysis and co-evolution of networks.

<p> The workshop will focus on processing large networks. Such networks can be directed as well as undirected, they can be labeled or unlabeled or they can be weighted or unweighted. Furthermore, network of networks is also of interest. Specific scientific topics of interest to the meeting include but are not restricted to: mining for patterns of interest in the networks, efficient exact and approximation algorithms that are either sequential or parallel for analyzing network properties. Recent methods for processing large networks such as map-reduce based frameworks, database techniques for processing networks. A particular topic of interest is to couple structural properties
of networks to the dynamics over networks, e.g. contagions.
