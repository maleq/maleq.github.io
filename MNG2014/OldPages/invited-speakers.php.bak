            <p><b>Trust, Influence and Urgent Diffusion in Social Media</b></p>
            
            <p><font size="2">The dramatic feature of social media is that it gives everyone a
voice; anyone can speak out and express their opinion to a crowd of
followers with little or no cost or effort, which creates a loud and
potentially overwhelming marketplace of ideas. The good news is that
the organizations have more data than ever about what their consumers
are saying about their brand. The bad news is that this huge amount of
data is difficult to sift through. We will look at developing methods
that can help sift through this torrent of data and examine important
questions, such as who do users trust to provide them with the
information that they want? Which entities have the greatest influence
on social media users? How does information diffuse in urgent
situations? Using agent-based modeling, machine learning and network
analysis we begin to examine and shed light on these questions and
develop a deeper understanding of the complex system of social media.</font></p>

            <p><b>Entity-Based Data Science</b></p>
            
            <p><font size="2">There is a growing interest in integrating,
            analyzing, visualizing, and making sense of large collections of 
            structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. In the world of
            big data, data science provides tools to help with this process Ð
            tools for cleaning the data, tools for integrating and aligning the
            data, tools for finding patterns in the data and making predictions,
            and tools for visualizing and interacting with the data. In this
            talk, I will focus on entity-based data science, data science
            techniques which support network analysis for computational social
            science. I will focus on the tasks of entity resolution (determining
            when two references refer to the same entity), collective
            classification (predicting missing entity labels in the network),
            and link prediction (predicting relationships) in a holistic manner
            which takes into account both entity attributes and relationships
            among the entities. I will overview of our recent work on
            probabilistic soft logic (PSL), a framework for collective,
            probabilistic reasoning in relational domains. Our recent results
            show that by using state-of-the-art optimization methods in a
            distributed implementation, we can solve large-scale problems with
            millions of random variables orders of magnitude more quickly than
            existing approaches.</font></p>

            <p><b>Data Tales from the World of Digital Advertising</b></p>
            
            <p><font size="2">Digital advertising is one of the fields on the
            forefront of exploring and exploiting digital user footprints. The
            main change in the world of data is its unprecedented granularity -
            particularly in measuring human behavior. Marketers in the past
            could only get as granular as demographic groups, like affluent
            middle-aged coffee-drinking parents. Targeted display advertising
            provides a multitude of challenges and opportunities for data
            analytics and predictive modeling. Billions of online display
            advertising spots are purchased on a daily basis through real time
            bidding exchanges (RTBs). Advertising companies bid for these spots
            on behalf of a company or brand in order to purchase these spots to
            display banner advertisements. These bidding decisions must be made
            in fractions of a second after the potential purchaser is informed
            of what location (Internet site) has a spot available and who would
            see the advertisement. The core analytical focus is to find good
            prospects for marketers and serving them ads while preserving their
            privacy. In particular, we do not tag browsers with any behavioral
            labels but instead work only with the set of hashed URLs that the
            browser has visited. These can be social media, user generated
            content, or more Internet sites in general. We use supervised
            machine learning techniques (including logistic regression and
            relatives of Na&iuml;ve Bayes) to build predictive models over millions
            of URLs. In this talk I will give some brief background on the
            industry and our core 'data agnostic' targeting algorithm. In the
            second half I will focus on a small set of related analytic
            solutions for fraud detection and bid optimization. </font></p>
