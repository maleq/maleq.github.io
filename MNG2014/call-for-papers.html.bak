<h4>Call for Papers</h4>

Real-world applications give rise to networks that are unstructured and often comprise of multiple-networks. Furthermore, they support multiple dynamical processes that shape the network over time. Network science refers to the broad discipline that seeks to understand the underlying principles that govern the synthesis, analysis and co-evolution of networks.

The workshop will focus on processing large networks. Such networks can be directed as well as undirected, they can be labeled or unlabeled or they can be weighted or unweighted. Furthermore, network of networks is also of interest. Specific scientific topics of interest to the meeting include but are not restricted to: mining for patterns of interest in the networks, efficient exact and approximation algorithms that are either sequential or parallel for analyzing network properties. Recent methods for processing large networks such as map-reduce based frameworks, database techniques for processing networks. A particular topic of interest is to couple structural properties of networks to the dynamics over networks, e.g. contagions.

The full-day workshop will feature: 2 invited talks, a session to showcase tools and systems individuals have developed in this area, contributed talks and short session on open problems and directions for future research. Papers that describe original and ongoing research as well as describe systems and tools are solicited.
