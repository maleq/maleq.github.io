<h2>Network Science </h2>


<h3>Description </h3>

Networks and dynamical systems underlie a large number of diverse natural and engineered systems, and over the past decade there has been a growing public fascination with the complex ``connectedness'' of modern society. These networks are highly irregular and their structure has a significant impact on the dynamics. Over the past decade, they have been studied extensively by researchers in a number of areas, including biology, statistical physics, mathematics, computer science, sociology, epidemiology and economics.
The goal of this course is to examine the general mathematical and
computational foundations of the research in these areas.
The topics will include basic graph theory and the structural properties of these graphs, dynamical systems, information cascades, power law phenomena, diffusion of innovations and fads, the small-world phenomenon, markets and strategic interaction on networks, epidemics, various simulation tools for generating and analyzing synthetic social contact networks and epidemics. <br>
<br>

<b>Graph theory and social networks:</b> graphs, weak ties, triadic closure, similarity and homophily, structural balance, random graphs, percolation. <br>

<b>Network dynamics:</b> theory  of network dynamics (dynamical process) -- SDS, population model, structural model, information cascades, network effects, power law, diffusion of information, small-world phenomenon. <br>

<b>Epidemic dynamics:</b> SIR and other epidemic models, branching process, simulation of epidemics, interventions and their effects. Markov chain model and its comparison with differential equation based models and relation to network structures, network-based dynamics vs. diff. eq.-based dynamics, a brief intro to renormalization group technique, Baysian networks, bi-criteria optimization for vaccination, structural analysis of a social network and its implication to epidimic dynamics.<br>

<b>Markets and strategic interaction on networks:</b> matching markets, price formation on a networks, bargaining and power in networks. <br>
