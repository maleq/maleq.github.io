<font size="4">Distributed Algorithms and Wireless Ad Hoc Sensor Networks:</font></b></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px">During my PhD
research work, I worked on developing distributed algorithms for various
problems, specifically the minimum spanning tree (MST) problem and the <i>k</i>-connected
subgraph problem. For general networks (<i>point-to-point communication model</i>),
we developed a distributed approximation algorithm for MST, which is
significantly faster than the existing MST algorithms. We also developed a
distributed <i>k</i>-connected subgraph algorithm, which is, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first non-trivial distributed algorithm for the <i>k</i>-connected
subgraph problem. I also worked on distributed algorithms for wireless sensor
networks (<i>wireless local broadcast model</i>). To build a data aggregation
tree, we developed energy-efficient distributed approximation algorithm for
constructing MST in a sensor network. For data aggregation such as sum, min,
max, count, and average, it can be shown that MST is the optimal data
aggregation tree. We analyzed our algorithms for both arbitrary distribution of
the sensor nodes and random uniform distribution of the nodes in a unit square
(a popular model for wireless ad hoc networks). We also worked on network
monitoring for general communication networks and developed an efficient
distributed network monitoring algorithm using edge routers only. This problem
becomes easier if we are allowed to use core routers. However, we avoided using
busy core router for monitoring purposes to allow the network to operate
effectively.</p>

<font size="4">Data Mining:</font></b></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 12px">During my masters program, I worked
on data mining of remotely sensed image data. We modified the <i>k</i>-nearest
neighbor classification technique for spatial data and obtained a better
classifier accuracy. To improve the running time of the classification
algorithm, we used a data-mining-ready structure called P-tree. I also worked on
using neural networks in data mining: using neural networks for classification,
prediction, feature extraction, and extracting classification rules from a
trained neural network. </p>
