        Keynote Talk: Fraud Detection with Networks and Beyond <br> <br>
        
        Abstract: Fraud is a prevalent problem -- almost wherever there is finances involved, there is fraud (e.g., tax fraud, identity theft, credit card fraud, auction fraud, bankruptcy fraud, etc.). Annual monetary loss to fraud can find tens of billions in any given domain. Networks, especially the power of "guilt-by-association", is essential for this problem domain, as most fraud is often opportunistic and/or organized. Beyond networks, there is often additional information about the entities or the environment involved, where leveraging all data sources effectively and collectively becomes a key and a challenge. In this talk, I will dive into two of our representative work: (i) bankruptcy fraud and (ii) opinion fraud. The key elements of (i) are supervised nature, available meta-data, and aspect of time, while those of (ii) include semi-/un-supervised nature as well as linguistic and behavioral aspects. I will show how networks play a key role in thinking about and formulating both of these problems. I will also show how data beyond networks can be leveraged for improved performance. I will highlight/summarize even more examples in the literature where networks have been successfully used for fraud detection (e.g., insider trading (Li), insider threat (Holder), auction fraud (Chau), corporate residence fraud (Provost), and securities fraud (Neville)). I will finish with open challenges in this problem domain, including network construction, transience, cost, adversary, and systems issues. <br><br>

         Invited talk by <a href = "http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bader/" target="_blank">David A. Bader </a> (Georgia Tech) <br> <br>
 
        Abstract: Emerging real-world graph problems include: detecting community structure in large social networks; improving the resilience of the electric power grid; and detecting and preventing disease in human populations. Unlike traditional applications in computational science and engineering, solving these problems at scale often raises new challenges because of the sparsity and lack of locality in the data, the need for additional research on scalable algorithms and development of frameworks for solving these problems on high performance computers, and the need for improved models that also capture the noise and bias inherent in the torrential data streams. In this talk, the speaker will discuss the opportunities and challenges in massive data-intensive computing for applications in computational science and engineering. <br> <br>

            Title of the Talk <br>
             Estimating Network Parameters
             <br><br>

            Abstract<br>
            Estimating the parameters of a large network, which cannot be accessed in its entirety, is a basic data mining question.  In this talk we address several questions in this context.  In particular, we focus on estimating the network size and the average degree.
