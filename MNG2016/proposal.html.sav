    <h3>Description of the workshop including objectives, content, topics of interest: </h3>

    Networks are emerging as a common language to model a wide variety of systems in life sciences, engineering, and social sciences. Real-world applications give rise to networks that are unstructured and often comprised of multiple-networks. Furthermore, they support multiple dynamical processes that shape the network over time. In some cases, the data relevant for mining patterns and making decisions comes from multiple heterogeneous sources and streams in over time. Graphs are a popular representation for such data because of their ability to represent different entity and relationship types, including the temporal relationships necessary to represent the dynamics of a data stream. However, fusing such heterogeneous data into a single graph or multiple related graphs and mining them are challenging tasks. Emerging massive data has made such tasks even more challenging. <br> <br>

    The workshop will focus on processing large networks and bring together researchers and practitioners in the field to deal with the emerging challenges in processing and mining large-scale networks. Such networks can be directed as well as undirected, they can be labeled or unlabeled, weighted or unweighted, and static or dynamic. Networks of networks and multi-layer networks are also of interest. Specific scientific topics of interest for this meeting include mining for patterns of interest in networks, efficient algorithms (sequential/parallel, exact/approximation) for analyzing network properties, methods for processing large networks, use of linear algebra and numerical analysis for mining complex networks, database techniques for processing networks, fusion of heterogeneous data sources into graphs, and methods for processing dynamic and streaming graphs. <br> <br>
    
    
    <h3> Description of the format: </h3>

    Our preference is full-day. But we are also open for a half-day workshop. <br><br>

    The full-day workshop (approximately 6 hours) will feature: one or two invited talks (50 minutes + 10 minutes Q&amp;A), contributed lectures (approximately 6-8 talks that are 15-20 minutes long), a short session and/or panel discussion on open problems and directions for future research.
    <br>
    <br>


    <h3> A short description of the target audience: </h3>

    The workshop is targeted for researchers interested in data mining, machine learning, massive data analytics, network science, social networks and high performance computing in its broadest sense. Both theoreticians as well as practitioners, including system builders and individuals applying network analytic methods in application domains will benefit from this workshop.

    <h3>A summary of previous editions of the workshop:</h3>

    The second workshop of the series was held in Vancouver in conjunction with SDM 2015. The workshop consisted of a keynote talk by Ravi Kumar (Google Inc.), four technical paper presentations, one demonstration, and a panel on future challenges in mining large networks. The workshop was co-chaired by the same organizers: Larry Holder, Maleq Khan, and Christine Klymko. The program committee consisted of 24 members. There were about 30 attendees in the workshop. The participants of the panel discussion were  Rajmonda Caceres, Nitesh Chawla, Tina Eliassi-Rad, David Gleich, Christine Klymko, Ravi Kumar, Aditya Prakash, and Jason Riedy.
