<h2 id="software">Recent Major Software Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li> I led the development of a graph algorithm library called Galib. Currently Galib contains implementations of at least 40 different, both parallel and sequential, efficient network and graph analysis algorithms. Some examples of the network analysis measures are diameter, shortest path, clustering coefficient, BFS, subgraphs, triangles, cliques, and various random graph generators. I wrote about one third of the codes myself and guided three graduate student in developing the rest. 

<li> I am also part of a team that developed a cyberinfrastructure for network science, called CINET. CINET provides a middleware and a web-based user interface for graph analysis. CINET contains over 200 networks and over 100 graph algorithms and generators. Among the networks, there are real-world, synthetic, and random networks. A user can also upload his own networks to the CINET system to analyze them using the provided graph analysis algorithms. CINET includes network analysis algorithms from Galib and two other such libraries: SNAP (developed at Stanford University) and NetworkX (developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory). 

<li> I have implemented a simulation software for simulating epidemic and contagious diseases. This simulator is designed to simulate contagious diseases for the entire US population that takes into account the long distance travel by various modes such as air travel and ground travel. Various statistical long distance travel data are used in the simulation model. This simulator has been used in an study of disaster response and an study of ebola outbreak done by our group for Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). 

<li> I have also played a significant role in another project at Virginia Tech: construction of synthetic populations and social contact networks for various countries of the world. This work uses land scan data, census data, and various commercial and open source survey data to construct synthetic populations and contact networks. These contact networks can be used to study contagious diseases in different countries.
